      "CodeSandbox is a project that manifested while I was working at Catawiki. I am responsible for rewriting pages to React and I noticed that my coworkers couldn't easily grasp what I was working on. Furthermore it was very hard to share my work with them without asking to install dependencies. CodeSandbox aims to solve this by making it possible to create React projects online in your browser. You can share your work by just sharing the URL, and it's very easy for others to play with.",
